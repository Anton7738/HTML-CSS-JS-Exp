Javascript
========================================

Uses two different runtimes

	1. NodeJS runtime (backend)
	2. Browser runtime (ie. V8 Engine @ Chrome, SpiderMonkey @ Firefox)

>> const variable = 20; -> declared, initialized (cannot reassign)

>> let counter = 0; -> declared (can be reassigned)
>> counter = counter++;
>> counter
1

>> const variable1 = 10;
>> typeof variable1;
"number"
